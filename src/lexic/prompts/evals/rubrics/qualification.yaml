step_name: qualification

dimensions:
  - name: Completeness
    description: Does the qualification report capture all required sections (summary, client profile, complexity, objectives with implicit goals, non-legal constraints)?
    weight: 0.3
    criteria:
      1: Missing multiple critical sections (3+ sections absent or severely incomplete)
      2: Missing one critical section or 2+ sections significantly incomplete
      3: All sections present but some details lacking (e.g., missing implicit goals or complexity justification)
      4: Comprehensive with only minor omissions
      5: Fully comprehensive, all sections fully developed

  - name: Accuracy
    description: Is the qualification report accurate given the client request? Are complexity rating, client profile, and goal inference appropriate?
    weight: 0.25
    criteria:
      1: Major inaccuracies or misinterpretations (wrong complexity level by 3+, inappropriate profile assessment)
      2: Several minor inaccuracies (complexity off by 2, some goals misidentified)
      3: Mostly accurate with few minor errors (complexity off by 1, mostly correct profile)
      4: Accurate with negligible errors
      5: Fully accurate, well-calibrated complexity and profile, correct goal inference

  - name: Constraint_Appropriateness
    description: Are constraints appropriate (budget, deadlines including future legal deadlines, relationships, risk tolerance) without including inappropriate legal constraints (past deadlines, burden of proof, jurisdiction, etc.)?
    weight: 0.2
    criteria:
      1: Significant inappropriate legal constraints included (past deadlines, burden of proof, jurisdictional issues, evidentiary challenges)
      2: Some inappropriate legal constraints mixed in (e.g., past prescription deadlines mentioned)
      3: Mostly appropriate but with minor inappropriate legal considerations
      4: Clearly appropriate constraints with future deadlines properly included
      5: Perfectly focused on appropriate constraints (budget, future legal deadlines, practical deadlines, relationships, risk)

  - name: Relevance
    description: Are irrelevant details excluded? Are implicit goals genuinely implicit (not just restating explicit ones)?
    weight: 0.15
    criteria:
      1: Significant irrelevant content included, implicit goals are just restatements
      2: Some irrelevant content, weak implicit goal inference
      3: Mostly relevant with minor tangents, reasonable implicit goals
      4: Highly relevant, insightful implicit goal identification
      5: Perfectly focused, excellent implicit goal inference

  - name: Clarity
    description: Is the qualification report well-structured with clear sections and clear complexity justification?
    weight: 0.1
    criteria:
      1: Poorly structured, difficult to understand, unclear sections
      2: Some structural issues, somewhat unclear complexity reasoning
      3: Adequately structured and clear
      4: Well-structured with clear complexity justification
      5: Exceptionally well-structured, crystal clear sections and reasoning
